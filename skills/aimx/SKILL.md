# Aimx

## Overview

Use `aimx` as a read-only evidence collector for `autoresearch` `log_experiment`
steps. Prefer JSON output so downstream agents can compare runs, explain model
effects, and propose the next experiment from concrete Aim data.

## Requirements

- Require `aimx` in the Python environment that runs `log_experiment`.
  Verify with `aimx --help` or `python -m aimx --help` before collecting data.
- When `aimx` is missing, first identify and follow the user's current
  dependency-management workflow from project files and instructions
  (`pyproject.toml`, lockfiles, README, AGENTS/CLAUDE/GEMINI notes, CI config).
  Use that manager to add or install `aimx`. In this repository, prefer
  `uv sync`, `uv run ...`, and `uv add aimx` because repo policy requires `uv`.
- If there is no project environment to modify and the user only needs a
  standalone CLI, install `aimx` as a tool using the user's preferred tool
  manager. Use `uv tool install aimx` only when `uv` is already the chosen or
  accepted tool workflow.
- Require read access to a local Aim repository path. Pass `--repo` explicitly
  and keep collection commands read-only.
- If native Aim availability matters for passthrough checks, run `aimx doctor`;
  do not initialize, repair, migrate, or rewrite Aim repositories from this
  skill.

## Workflow

1. Locate the Aim repository. Pass `--repo <repo-root-or-.aim>` explicitly; in
   this repository, use `--repo data` or `--repo data/.aim` for local checks.
2. Define the run scope as an AimQL expression. Start broad with
   `run.hash != ''`, then narrow by `run.hash`, `run.experiment`, or `run.name`.
3. Collect run parameters:

   ```bash
   aimx query params "<run-scope>" --repo <repo> --json
   aimx query params "<run-scope>" --repo <repo> --json --param hparam.lr --param model
   ```

4. Collect metric summaries for candidate objective metrics:

   ```bash
   aimx query metrics "(<run-scope>) and metric.name == 'loss'" --repo <repo> --json
   aimx query metrics "(<run-scope>) and metric.name != ''" --repo <repo> --json
   ```

5. Collect traces only for decisive metrics or suspected anomalies:

   ```bash
   aimx trace "(<run-scope>) and metric.name == 'loss'" --repo <repo> --json --tail 50
   ```

6. Inspect distribution traces when weight, activation, or gradient histograms
   matter. Prefer JSON/CSV for automation; use the default visual output for
   human terminal inspection.

   ```bash
   aimx trace distribution "<distribution-expr>" --repo <repo> --json --tail 5
   aimx trace distribution "distribution.name != ''" --repo <repo> --step 12300
   ```

7. Collect image metadata when qualitative outputs matter:

   ```bash
   aimx query images "images" --repo <repo> --json --head 20
   ```

8. Emit a compact `log_experiment` record containing:

   ```json
   {
     "repo": "<repo>",
     "run_scope": "<AimQL>",
     "params": {},
     "metric_summary": {},
     "trace_evidence": {},
     "distribution_evidence": {},
     "image_evidence": {},
     "interpretation": {
       "best_runs": [],
       "regressions": [],
       "confidence": "low|medium|high",
       "next_experiments": []
     }
   }
   ```

## Interpretation Rules

- Prefer validation, test, or held-out contexts over training contexts when
  ranking runs.
- Treat `aimx query metrics` as summary data: `last`, `min`, `max`, and step
  counts. Use `aimx trace --json` when shape, stability, divergence, or late
  improvement matters.
- Use `aimx trace distribution --json` or `--csv` for automated histogram
  evidence. The unflagged distribution command is a non-interactive terminal
  visual that lists matched distributions, selects the first non-empty series,
  and renders a current-step histogram plus step-by-bin heatmap. `--step N`
  affects only this visual mode and falls back to the nearest tracked step.
- For minimization metrics such as loss or error, compare `min.value` and the
  corresponding step. For maximization metrics such as accuracy, F1, AUC, or
  IoU, compare `max.value`.
- Separate incomplete or failed runs from strong results before drawing
  conclusions. Very low step counts, missing params, or missing validation
  metrics should reduce confidence.
- Preserve read-only behavior. Do not run commands that initialize, repair,
  migrate, delete, or rewrite Aim repositories during `log_experiment`.

## Helper Script

Use `scripts/collect_experiment_snapshot.py` when an agent needs one structured
JSON bundle instead of several manual commands.

```bash
uv run python skills/aimx/scripts/collect_experiment_snapshot.py \
  --repo data \
  --base-expr "run.experiment == 'cloud-segmentation'" \
  --metric loss \
  --trace-metric loss \
  --param hparam.lr \
  --param model \
  --pretty
```

The script uses the current Python interpreter as `python -m aimx` by default.
Pass `--aimx "aimx"` or `--aimx "uv run aimx"` when a different launcher is
needed. It writes only to stdout.

Read `references/aimx-cli.md` for command details, JSON envelope shapes, and
suggested `log_experiment` evidence fields.
